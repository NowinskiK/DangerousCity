# Dangerous City ![](doc\icons8-great-britain-48.png)
Language: **English** | [Polish](README_PL.md)

A game I wrote for the 8-bit Atari in 1994 (I was 16 at the time).  
I prepared two versions: one with the MIRAGE logo, and another with the LK AVALON logo, but neither of the companies decided to commercially release the game.

# Edition 2023
Work on the new edition began back in 2022, when KAZ proposed releasing this title as part of the [Polish Society for the Protection of Technical Heritage](https://ptodt.org.pl/). We quickly established the preliminary scope of work, and [the full list of changes can be read here](./ChangeLog.md).  
Today, we already know that the game will be released on a cartridge, and the entire package will be available in a boxed version.

# ATARI - Quick Assembler

Folder [src/QA](./src/QA/) includes the original files copied from my disks, which survived for over 20 years, first in an apartment, then in a basement.


# PC - Assember for C64 Studio environment

The [src/C64S](./src/C64S/) folder contains a complete solution and project that allows you to compile the game using the `C64 Studio` environment.  
If you want to run the program from the source code on a PC platform – [in this folder](./doc/) you will find a presentation describing step by step how to set up the environment.  
> Please note that this version of the code is not fully compatible with QA.  

To achieve full compatibility and greater capabilities – the entire code has been prepared in the next folder: MADS (read below).

# PC - Assember dla MADS

The [src/MADS](./src/MADS/) folder contains a set of files that allow you to compile the game using [Mad-Assembler](https://github.com/tebe6502/Mad-Assembler) (MADS).
